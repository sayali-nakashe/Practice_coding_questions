  - Why Interesting/ Useful?
    -Can be used by college students to find the safest area to live.
      -For example: USC students can use visualizations that can help them to find the safest area to live in.
    -Can be used by residents to find crime rates in a particular area to buy properties.
    -Can be used by the Police to stay vigilant and take preventive measures against recurring crimes.
  -Secret Sauce:
